## General Information
- SonarLume Bracelet is an innovative wearable gadget.
- Coded in Python, this gadget serves as an assistive device for those with hearing impairments.
- It creates a fun and interactive experiences by responding to the sonic environment around you.
- I developed this gadget out of my love for music and concerts, as well as being inspired by a friend with a hearing impairment.
- The gadget will turn into a deeper blue the quieter the surrounding environment. 
- Conversely, the louder the environment, the more red the gadget will become.
- Spectrum of sound: deep blue_blue_cyan_teal_green_yellow-green_yellow_orange_red-orange_red


## Technologies Used
- Circuit Playground Express- version 1.0


## Features
- Changes colour based on whether sound environment is loud or quiet.
- Quiet environment will make the CPX turn blue. 
- Mid-volume environments will make the CPX turn greenish-yellow
- Loud environments will make the CPX turn red.  


## Setup
- Required to be connected to sufficient power supply- via USB or using at least X3 AAA battery pack.
- Simply connect the CPX to a sufficient power source and it will start reacting!

## Project Status
Project is:  _complete/no longer_being_worked_on_because_it_is_complete.


## Room for Improvement
For future development: 
To do:
- add static feature- where a click of button can let user change between reactive colour setting and static colours.
- add pre-set colour features- similar click of button to change setting. 


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by my personal love for concerts and the light-up bracelets at concert events.
- This project was based on the Playground Sound Meter developed by Dan Halbert, Tony DiCola and Kattni Remora (2017), published on Adafruit Insutries learn page. 
- Many thanks to UTS FASS teaching staff and my brother for facilitating my coding learning journey.
